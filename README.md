- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pretty much everything when it comes to programming, I've dabbled with most OOP languages and tend to spend my time with those, but honestly I just like learning new things a lot.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning returning to Python since I have not used it in roughly a year and want to brush up on it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at robjgraham1996@gmail.com
