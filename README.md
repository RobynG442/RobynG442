- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pretty much everything when it comes to programming, I've dabbled with most OOP languages and tend to spend my time with those, but honestly I just like learning new things a lot.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel PHP, I hadn't had much experience with PHP in general since university and that was pretty barebones, Laravel has been a lot of fun to learn and I want to see how much I can do with it.
